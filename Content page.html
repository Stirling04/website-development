        <h1 style="color:blue;">Affordable & sustainable energy</h1>

        <p style="color:blue;">INTRO:</p>
        <p style="color:blue;">As everyone knows we as a species rely on vast amounts of energy in out daily lives.
        In general, there are two types of energy being renewable & non-renewable, examples of renewable energy sources include;
    wind, solar and nuclear, whereas non-renwable energy resources include fossil fuels which are coal, oil and natural gas these are also called
finite resources as they will run out. Furthermore, by incressingly using fossil fuels, we increase our greenhouse emissions which can result in great climate change implications.
However, by using renewable energy sources we can help decrease the greenhouse gases which greatly help mitigate climate change. In addition, by protecting naturally occuring 
ecosystems, we are further developing hydropower sources of electresity and bioenergy. </p>
<p style="color:blue;">MAIN:</p>
<p style="color:blue;">Ideally we need to limit the amount of harmful emissions we are emitting into the atmosphere as they will increase global warming and also they are 
finite resources, so eventually they will run out. In relation to this, there are roughly 3 billion people ho rely on coal, charcoal and animal waste for cooking and general heeating,
these are all examples of fossil fuels and they emitt harmful gases into the amosphere. Also, since 1990, global emissions of CO2 have greatyly increased by mor ethen 45%!!!.
Then, in regards to renewable energy, hydropower which is where we utilise water to generate energy to heat and cook food is a large energy resourec and provides roughly 16% of the worlds energy.
However, bioenergy is the single largest renewable energy source today, which provides about 10% of world primary energy supply. Furthermore, by 2030, we estimate that we have 
universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, also, by 2030 we estimate that we will double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiancy, also,
we will increase the sustainability to share reneable energy in the global energy mix .</p>
<p style="color:blue;">Conclusion:</p>
<p style="color:blue;">So, in conclusion, we as humans must improve the efficiancy in that we use energy as using non-renwable energy resources continue to harm the planet and have great consequences 
for global warming such as rising temperature and rising tides. So we need to continue to use renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and nuclear to name a few.
These resources are not finite which means they will not run out, and we can use them efficently. Furthermore, by using reneable energy resources we will help decrease climate change and make a safer/sustainable world for all.</p>
